# EffectiveCollisionsGame

The goal of this game is to explore and discover the world as well as its emergent fundamental physical and chemical reactions to survive. It's a little bit like the recent "Noita" title, except you have the freedom to explore a huge open world and play with your friends; at least, that's the vision. 

I can't really recal the first time I ever thought about this idea. Voxels have always made my hearth race, as well as emergent behaviours in general. The more chaotic and ordered a law of nature is, the more I'm actually interrested in it, as counter intuitive as that law might be. 

That's the whole point of this game. I want to be be able to discover a whole proceduraly driven world even though I myself have created it all from scratch.
